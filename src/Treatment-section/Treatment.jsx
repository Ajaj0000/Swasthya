                          Diabetes is a lifelong disease. It is a metabolic
                          disorder in which the level of glucose in the blood of
                          the patient is very high. When a person's body does
                          not produce enough insulin and the cells of the body
                          do not respond properly to insulin. Against this, the
                          production of insulin is very important for the body
                          as it transports glucose from the blood to the cells
                          of the body. That is why, when insulin is not made in
                          the right amount, then it also affects the body
                          metabolism of the victim.

                        <h2>Types of Diabetes:</h2>
                        <p>
                          From the food we eat, the body gets glucose which the
                          cells use to provide energy to the body. If insulin is
                          not present in the body, then it cannot do its work
                          properly and cannot deliver glucose from the blood to
                          the cells. Due to this glucose accumulates in the
                          blood itself and excess glucose in the blood can prove
                          to be harmful. There are generally 3 types of
                          diabetes-

                        <h2>Diabetes Causes:</h2>
                        <p>
                          When the body is not able to use the glucose or sugar
                          present in the blood properly. Then, the person
                          develops the problem of diabetes. Generally, the main
                          causes of diabetes can be these conditions-

                          rapidly and are also quite severe. The main symptoms

                        <h2>Diagnosis of Diabetes:</h2>

                          patient has to undergo a blood test once every 3
                          months, and his average blood glucose level is
                          checked. The A1C test measures the level of glucose in
                          the blood in numbers ranging from 5 to 10. If the test
                          report shows a figure below 5.7 then it is normal. But
                          if someone's A1C level is seen as more than 6.5%, then

                          After that fasting plasma glucose test is done. This
                          test is done to detect diabetes or prediabetes.

                          In this test too, a blood sample is taken while on an
                          empty stomach. Two hours before the test, the patient
                          is given a beverage containing glucose.

                          is tested 4 times. If the blood sugar level is found
                          to be more than twice the normal, then the pregnant
                          woman is confirmed to have gestational diabetes.
