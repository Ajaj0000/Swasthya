                or exercising.When injured the two main systems affected are the
                nervous and vascular systems. The origins in the body where
                numbness and tingling occurs upon sports injuries are usually
                the first signs of the body telling you that the body was
                impacted.

              <h3> Pediatric Rehabilitation</h3>
              <p>
                Pediatric rehabilitation is about more than building strength
                and improving function. It’s about inspiring children to gain
                the skills and confidence to reach their full potential. And
                it’s also about supporting families throughout the
                rehabilitation process.
